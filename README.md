Project #1: PROJECT DIY






# Project Description
 Our project is to create an application for anyone who wants to learn DIY projects, find hotspots for art, and save their favorite art projects. The main feature of our application is to present "Project Ideas" and provide "Art Hotspots". The user can get project "how to" videos from different categories. There are 10 categories and in each category there are 6 project ideas videos. There are also 4 categories in the Art Hotspots section and 6 hotspot locations in each category. In addition, the user can save their favorite projects to their favorites. The user's favorites is saved in local storage and it persists when the user clicks refresh. The user also has the option of removing a favorite from the favorites page. Our live page can be seen in the <a href="#Table of Contents">Table of Contents</a> section.  You can <a href=https://github.com/hannybear88/Project-1-Project-DIY/>Click here</a>  to see our code for this project.

## Challenges
Some challenges we faced was when we tried to figure how to use the api for Pinterest, Reddit, and Devianart. It was a long process where we had to fill out applications and get approved. We got some help from Eyvette and Brian, however, we were unsuccessful in being able to easily use any of 3 apis mentioned above. We had applied to Pinterest twice since the first time we did not mention it was for educational purposes. So, the second time we applied we let them know that this is for educational purposes only. While we waited for a response, we had looked into Reddit and unfortunately, it had the same requirements for Pinterest. We had applied there to use the api too. While we waiting for a response from Reddit, we looked for another alternative and found Marvin thought of DevianArt. It took awhile to figure it out, however, it seemed like a long process just like Pinterest and Reddit. Unfortunately, we were denied access to Reddit and as well as Pinterest for the 2nd time. Due to that we had to shift our focus on the "Ideas" section and change it to "Hotspots". We ran into a CORS issue, but we had some help again from Eyvette and Brian that led in the right direction on how to fix the issue.Another issue that we had encountered was not being able to put in a search bar. Due to not having enough time, we had decided to put it as part of a future development.



## Successes 
We had successfully created our deployed application. We were able to stay on the topic and just had to shift our focus which was okay because we were happy we didn't have to completely change our ideas and topic. Using the APIs that ended up choosing and successfully fetched information related to our topic. Everyone in the group was so easy going and willing to do their part and kept their word on doing their part. Everyone was helpful with each other with any questions they had. We all communicated really well.
