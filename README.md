## Challenges
Some challenges we faced was when we tried to figure how to use the api for Pinterest, Reddit, and Devianart. It was a long process where we had to fill out an applications and get approved. We got some help from the TAs and Brian, however, we were unsuccessful in being able to easily use the apis. We had applied again to Pinterest letting them know that this is for educational purposes only. While we waited for a response, we had looked into Reddit and unfortunately, it had the same requirements for Pinterest. We had applied there to use the api too. We didn't want to just wait around and not continue on the project, so we looked for another alternative and found DevianArt. It took awile to figure it out, however, it seemed like a long process just like Pinterest and Reddit. We had to shift our focus on the "Ideas" section and change it to "Hotspots".
